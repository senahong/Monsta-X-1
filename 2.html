<h2>Artistry</h2>
<p>
Monsta X is known for having a unique style, often described as intense
 or aggressive; they combine elements of hip hop, EDM and pop. Philip
 Merrill described their sound for the Grammy's news publication as distinct
 in the K-pop scene with Monsta X "adding their Korean eclectic backgrounds
 to a meld between American rap, rock and pop, they bring a throbbing
 rhythmic bounce, lyrics hard enough to slide in raps at will, melodies
 pop enough to hold you, all with a rock edge as the greater context". Their
 aggressive style with "tracks centred around loud, clattering, electronic
 instrumentals, vicious rap verses and striking vocals" has been influential
 across the fourth generation of K-pop.
