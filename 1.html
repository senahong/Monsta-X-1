<h2>History</h2>
The group was formed as the result of a survival program called No.Mercy,
which was launched by Starship Entertainment and Mnet in December 2014.
Through the course of ten episodes, twelve trainees (thirteen after I.M
joins the competition in episode 8) competed against each other through
various performances and are ranked from one to twelve, with one being the
best and twelve being the worst. They also have to wear a nametag with their
ranking that changed following the challenges and performances set by the
judges. For the show, the participants worked directly with artists from
Starship Entertainment, including Hyolyn, K.Will, Mad Clown, and Soyou as
well as other artists such as Rhymer, San E, Giriboy and Genius Nochang.
These artists also served as judges for ranking the contestants. For the c
oncluding mission, the nine remaining members formed into three groups of
three to compete and the members of Monsta X were selected from these nine
in the final episode as the seven members of the group: Shownu, Wonho,
Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Jooheon, and I.M.
